			<key>Question</key>
			<string>1. I am an insomnia patient. When should I use &quot;Somnormal&quot;?</string>
			<key>Answer</key>
			<string>Answer: It is recommended to use 2 times a day for the first two weeks of treatment, and then use once a day for the next four weeks, and then once every two days subsequently or follow doctor&apos;s recommendation, gradually reduce the use frequency until the symptom improvements become completely stable. If you feel sober minded, relaxed and focused after each treatment, then do not use within three hours before going to bed; but if you feel drowsy and can fall asleep every time after use, then you can use at bedtime. The recommended time to use Somnormal is once in the morning and once in the afternoon, with an interval of more than three hours.</string>

			<key>Question</key>
			<string>2. How much intensity I should use?</string>
			<key>Answer</key>
			<string>Answer: For first time use, gradually increase from level 1 until the ears feel a faint tingling (feeling of beating). Intensity should not be too large, or it might cause headache, dizziness, nausea or other adverse reactions, depending on individual.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>Question</key>
			<string>3. How to select stimulation mode?</string>
			<key>Answer</key>
			<string>Answer: Normal mode is &quot;Mode 1&quot;, which should function relatively well. If symptom persists after two weeks of use, you can switch to &quot;Mode 2&quot; and continue treatment. If you no longer feel tingling at the ears after days or weeks of using &quot;Mode 1&quot; or &quot;Mode 2&quot; regardless of stimulation intensity, use &quot;Mode 3&quot; once and then continue treatment with the previously used mode.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>Question</key>
			<string>4. Does using Somnormal frequently at high intensity help treating insomnia easier and faster?</string>
			<key>Answer</key>
			<string>Answer: No. Stimulation intensity should only cause faint tingling or feeling of beating at the ears, not too strong. Besides, increasing daily use frequency will not accelerate the insomnia treatment, and the user should follow the treatment course patiently. Insomnia treatment is a long term process, and should not be treated hastily.</string>

		<dict>
			<key>Question</key>
			<string>5. What should I do when I experience headache, dizziness, nausea or other adverse events when using &quot;Somnormal&quot;?</string>
			<key>Answer</key>
			<string>Answer: First, do not panic, because the symptoms occur due to excessive stimulation intensity or stimulation frequency. Reduce stimulation intensity or stimulation frequency immediately; if the symptoms persist, stop using Somnormal and consult doctor immediately.</string>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>Question</key>
			<string>6. I can sleep using medication. Can I use &quot;Cervella&quot;?</string>
			<key>Answer</key>
			<string>Answer: Yes. Medication can easily cause side effects to the human body, so it should be used less; Somnormal is a safe and effective physical therapy, and will not adversely affect the human body. However if you can sleep with medication, do not stop medication at early stage of Somnormal treatment, but instead use only half the dosage with concurrent Somnormal treatment. After the sleep condition is stable a week later, reduce dosage appropriately and ultimately get rid of the medications. Do not be hasty on reducing medication, and only reduce the dosage when symptoms have become stable.</string>

			<key>Question</key>
			<string>1. Why is it that I cannot adjust the stimulation intensity?</string>
			<key>Answer</key>
			<string>Answer:（1）Somnormal is not connected (Somnormal Host). Please bind Somnormal via Bluetooth first. If you do not have Somnormal, please purchase from us. 
	             （2）the phone you use does not support Bluetooth 4.0 function (Bluetooth of your handphone cannot find &quot;Sleep4U-xxxxxxxxxxxx&quot; device). Please change to cell-phones that support Bluetooth 4.0 to connect to Somnormal.</string>

			<key>Question</key>
			<string>2. Why is it that when I press &quot;Start&quot; in the timer circle, and the timer number flashes without changing?</string>
			<key>Answer</key>
			<string>Answer: Connect &quot;Somnormal&quot; properly and set stimulation mode before starting. The timer number is not changing because the electrode cables are not connected properly. Please check if the felts on the earpieces are soaked with saline, check whether the earclips and earlobes are intact, and check the connection of the electrode cable plug and Somnormal.</string>
